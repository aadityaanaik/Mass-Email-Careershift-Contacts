I am Aditya Naik, and I recently graduated from Texas A&M University with a Masterâ€™s degree in Management Information Systems. I am actively looking for full-time employment opportunities in the field of data engineering. I have attached my resume for your reference.

About Me: (More on adityanaik.info)

I am an AWS certified engineer, having previously worked in the banking industry with HSBC as a data engineer for 3+ years. In the US, I worked as a data engineer at Texas A&M University for about 2 years. I have handled, managed, and maintained petabytes of data in both roles with a combined experience of 5 years.

My experience portrays extensive knowledge of SQL, Python, Spark, Kafka, Airflow, GCP, and AWS. I have worked on distributed systems frameworks like HDFS, developed ETL pipelines using AWS Glue, processed large data sets using EMR, and optimized SQL performance tuning to improve query performance. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am adept at communicating complex technical concepts to stakeholders at all levels.
